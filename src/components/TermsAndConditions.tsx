        In return for around 35 hours work - approx. 4.5 hours a day - we offer
        you a festival ticket with camping (if you want to camp that is) this
        gives you access to all events (space allowing), a Workforce T shirt to
        wear on duty and an opportunity to be part of a fantastic team of
        volunteers.
