            seriously and be punctual and reliable.

            We expect you to wear the free Workforce t-shirt and ID pass, while
            on duty, so everyone knows you are on the team. The festival
            reserves the right to dismiss volunteers if they bring the festival
            into disrepute or disregard terms and conditions.

            Our volunteer teams each have a manager who will direct you in your
